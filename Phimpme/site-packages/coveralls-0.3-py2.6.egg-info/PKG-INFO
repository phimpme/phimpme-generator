        `Coveralls.io`_ is service to publish your coverage stats online with a lot of `nice features`_.
        This package provides seamless integration with ``coverage.py`` in your python projects.
        For ruby projects, there is an `official gem`_.
        Only projects hosted on Github are supported.
        
        Works with python 2.6+, 3.2+ and pypy 1.9.

        Usage (Travis CI)
        -----------------
        
        This library will publish your coverage results on coveralls.io for everyone to see (unless you're using pro account).
        This package can possibly work with different CI environments, but it's only tested to work with `Travis CI`_ atm.
        
        1. First, log in via Github and `add your repo`_ on Coveralls website.
        2. Add ``pip install coveralls`` to ``install`` section of ``.travis.yml``
        3. Make sure you run your tests with coverage during the build in ``script`` part. Example::
        
            # --source specifies what packages to cover, you probably want to use that option
            script:
                coverage run --source=yourpackagename setup.py test
        
           Note, that example command will gather coverage for specified package.
           If you wish to customize what's included in your reports, consult `coverage docs`_.
        
        .. _coverage docs: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/
        
        4. Execute run ``coveralls`` in ``after_success`` section::
        
            after_success:
              - coveralls
        
        Full example of .travis.yml::
        
            language: python
            python:
              - 2.7
              - 3.3
            install:
              - pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
              - pip install coveralls --use-mirrors
            script:
              - coverage run --source=moscowdjango,meetup manage.py test
            after_success:
              - coveralls
        
        Usage (another CI)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you're NOT using Travis, you have to provide at least a ``repo_token`` option in ``.coveralls.yml``
        at the root of your repo. This is your own secret token, which is available at the bottom of your repository's page on Coveralls.
        Make sure it stays **secret**, do not put it in your public repo.
        
        Example of .coveralls.yml::
        
            # .coveralls.yml
            repo_token: TjkDuVpGjuQcRhNW8dots9c8SSnv7ReM5
        
        .. _add your repo: https://coveralls.io/repos/new
        .. _Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        It makes custom report for data generated by ``coverage.py`` package and sends it to `json API`_ of coveralls.io service.
        All python files in your coverage analysis are posted to this service along with coverage stats,
        so please make sure you're not ruining your own security! For private projects there is `Coveralls Pro`_.

        Tips for coverage.rc config
        ---------------------------
        
        This section is a list of most common options for coverage.py, which collects all the data.
        Coveralls feeds from this data, so it's good to know how to to configure it.
        
        To limit the `report with only your packages`_, specify their names (or directores)::
        
          [run]
          source = coveralls,your_otherpackage
        
        To exclude parts of your source from coverage, for example migrations folders::
        
          [run]
          omit = */migrations/*
        
        Some lines are never executed in your tests, but that can be ok. 
        To mark those lines use inline comments right in your source code::
        
          if debug:   # pragma: no cover
            msg = "blah blah"
            log_message(msg, a)
        
        Sometimes it can be tedious to mark them in code, so you can `specify whole lines to .coveragerc`_::
        
          [report]
          exclude_lines =
              pragma: no cover
              def __repr__
              raise AssertionError
              raise NotImplementedError
              if __name__ == .__main__.:
        
        .. _report with only your packages: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/source.html#source
        .. _specify whole lines to .coveragerc: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/excluding.html
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Run tests::
        
            $ python setup.py test
        
        Install latest `unstable version`_::
        
            $ pip install coveralls==dev
        
        .. _unstable version: https://github.com/coagulant/coveralls-python/archive/master.zip#egg=coveralls-dev
